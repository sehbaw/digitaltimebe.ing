<div class="main">
<p> About a couple of months ago I found this really cool band: Naturosynth. I found
    them mainly because they were on this list of south asian american musicians but ended up really enjoying their music. 
    I find it difficult these days to find bands that write about a variety of things
    and have a good range when to comes to sound. </p>

<div> 
  <p>As someone really inspired by music I found myself drawn to creating live visuals for them
    to potentially play at their shows. In addition to live performance artwork, I also made a couple of flyers
